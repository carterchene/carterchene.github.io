Data engineer currently driving data innovation at Dakota Analytics in Calgary.
I use a huge variety of tech stacks, but I'm most familiar with [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/), [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca). In my spare time, I like to stay active by running and lifting weights. 

I received my Bachelor's degree in Physics with Honours from the University of British Columbia (UBC), specializing in Computational Physics. This background has provided me with a strong foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving and coding skills that I apply to my work.

Check out my personal projects below. 

### Projects

- [Streaming on AWS with Flink](https://github.com/carterchene/flink-streaming-demo): A streaming pipeline that replicates a music streaming platform, all on AWS resources. It uses [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) on [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/). [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) is used as the warehouse and [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) is used as the BI tool. 

- [Web Scraping DrugAge](https://github.com/carterchene/longevity-drugs-analysis): An ETL pipeline scraping data from [drug age](https://genomics.senescence.info/) using [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [duckDB](https://duckdb.org/), [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). See the live app [here](https://drug-age-analysis.azurewebsites.net/) (hosted in Azure with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/))

- [Datawarehouse Management App](https://github.com/carterchene/datawarehouse-management-app): An app for writing data to Google BigQuery. I have frequently encountered clients that need to write data back at the data warehouse level. I have successfully addressed this challenge using various technologies, including Streamlit, PowerApps, Django, Excel, and SharePoint. In this project, I leverage [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [AgGrid](https://www.ag-grid.com/), which strike a great balance between simplicity (compared to Django) and front-end control (compared to Streamlit).
