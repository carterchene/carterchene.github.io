My name is Carter. I'm a Data Engineer based in Calgary, currently working at Dakota Analytics. I specialize in transforming complex data into valuable insights and building robust data infrastructure.
I enjoy coding and working with data to solve challenging problems. In my spare time, I like to stay active by running and lifting weights. 

I received my Bachelor's degree in Physics with Honours from the University of British Columbia (UBC), specializing in Computational Physics. This background has provided me with a strong foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving and coding skills that I apply to my work in data engineering.

Check out my projects below to see examples of my work in data engineering and analytics.
