Data engineer currently driving data innovation at Dakota Analytics in Calgary.
I use a huge variety of tech stacks, but I'm most familiar with [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/), [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca). In my spare time, I like to stay active by running and lifting weights. 

I received my Bachelor's degree in Physics with Honours from the University of British Columbia (UBC), specializing in Computational Physics. This background has provided me with a strong foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving and coding skills that I apply to my work.

Check out my personal projects below.
